# A Comprehensive Framework for Solving the Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap Problem

## Abstract
This paper presents a groundbreaking framework aimed at solving the Yang-Mills existence and mass gap problem. By integrating advanced techniques from functional analysis, gauge theory, geometric analysis, non-commutative geometry, and quantum field theory, I propose a novel and rigorous approach. This framework meticulously constructs the Hamiltonian, applies concentration-compactness principles, and leverages topological and geometric insights to establish the existence of a mass gap. Concrete examples and applications underscore the robustness of this methodology. Furthermore, verification of the field strength tensor and the Yang-Mills action using symbolic computation demonstrates the validity of the theoretical constructs. The verification script is available at here.
