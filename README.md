# A Comprehensive Framework for Solving the Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap Problem

The Yang-Mills mass gap problem asks whether the fundamental particles in certain quantum field theories have a positive mass, even though the theory itself doesn't specify a mass. My solution combines advanced mathematical techniques from different areas, like functional analysis and non-commutative geometry, to rigorously prove that these particles indeed have a positive mass, thereby solving the problem in a novel and integrated way.
